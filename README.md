# Suite-Talk

Automate hotel review intake, analyze sentiment, and open tickets for negative feedback, all with a config-driven n8n workflow.


Why Suite Talk?

Guest feedback is scattered across Google & TripAdvisor. Managers miss issues, and quarterly reporting takes forever.
Suite Talk pulls reviews automatically, normalizes them, scores sentiment, and (optionally) creates Zendesk tickets for fast follow-up, while storing everything in Postgres for reporting.


What it does

Ingests reviews from Google My Business and a configurable TripAdvisor endpoint

Normalizes different payloads into one schema

Dedupes by offset so each run only processes new items

Sentiment analysis via OpenAI Chat Completions

Auto-tickets negative reviews in Zendesk (toggleable)

Stores all reviews in Postgres for analytics


Workflow at a glance
Cron (hourly)
  → PG Init (idempotent schema)
  → PG Load (hotels, sources, settings, last_seen)
      ├─ IF provider == google      → HTTP Google Reviews
      └─ IF provider == tripadvisor → HTTP TripAdvisor Reviews
  → Normalize (Code)  // unify shape + filter by last_seen
  → OpenAI (HTTP POST) // sentiment
  → Parse (Code)       // score + label
  → PG Upsert (reviews)
  → PG Offset (advance last_seen)
  → IF Negative?
       → IF Zendesk enabled?
            → Zendesk: Create Ticket
